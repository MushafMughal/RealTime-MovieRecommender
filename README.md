# RealTime-MovieRecommender
This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System built using Streamlit and powered by The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The system recommends movies based on user input by leveraging **cosine similarity** and **text vectorization** techniques. The model is preprocessed and trained on real-time movie data fetched from the TMDb API.
